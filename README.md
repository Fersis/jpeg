# jpeg

A jpeg decoder c++ implementation, converts RGB values to a bmp file in order to show the final result.

This implementation still has many bugs, e.g. it can't parse progressive images, and the program itself has many redundant operations, which can be further optimized.

I refer to many other's codesï¼Œincluding:

To run the progame, you need specify command line parameters which is the name of jpg file excluding .jpg suffix, e.g. sunflower not sunflower.jpg.
AND, IT WILL TAKE LONG TIME TO RUN....

Update depends on my mood.
